            You maybe found on the website some phrases.
            This are all types of thoughts and this page will make display them all with some additional text about the deeper meaning.

        <p class="saying">"The moment a constellation of mass in states. Not temporary. Only elsewhere in space."</p>
        <p>The idea of this saying is for me more a religious meaning based of scientific principals which have not yet been fully proven.
            It deals with the relativistic relationship between space and time. The actual state of the universe is described, regardless of our measurements. 
            Namely, the statement that time does not exist and actually stands still until we measure. And senses or the existence of life results inevitable in a measurement.<br />...<br />
            On an planet with higher gravity a body moves slower with same amount of energy. 
            At a critical mass or gravity the body stops moving.
            Same is happening to light close to a massive object like a black hole. It stops moving.
            During the fusion process of black holes a tiny dynamic can be measured by detecting the gravity waves of the event.
            The masses of the black holes expand into each other.
            At a critical mass you have a type of event called "big bang".
            The preconditions in each black hole prior to the event are always the same. 
            So the masses expand always the same into each other. 
            They are falling always the same way arround each other to create matter, stars and all kind of known object. 
            Everthing, us, the histrory and future is always happening the same.
            If the masses fall in an infinite way in an infinite space, they are not falling at all.
            So every constellational part of the process must be somewhere.
