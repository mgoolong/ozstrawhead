    <h2>Past</h2>
    <h3>My time in school</h3>
    <div class="container">
    <p>
        School was a hard time for me. Always something else on my mind it was hard for me to deliver what they called home work. 
        Beside this I was a good student and made the chance to study economics. 
        I realized it was not what I wanted and searched for something to orient myself.
        The conclusion was to start learning in the hotel industry because every hotel it is a small world of its own.
        You can learn cooking, languages, all types of people, costumer service, technical equipment, sales and marketing, accounting,
        sport and entertainment and many more.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Me and the hotel world</h3>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="saying">"The world is like a hotel. We are all just guests. Checking in and checking out."</p>
    <p>
        It was a great time and I learned a lot. At the end I worked more then a decade in different international hotels of higher category in europe.
        The most time I worked for the reception and accounting departments. Also with management roles.
        Unfortunately I stopped due to the negative cercumstances of the industry. 
        The ongoing battle on the marked resulted in cost efficiency measures what directly made impact to team budgets, work and development quality.
        I searched for a new employeer and was lucky to find a good spoot in the HR Department in HR service clusters in Europe.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h3>My current tasks</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            At my current company I started at Learning Management for the Belgium Group Companies.
            Later I also got responsibilites in Organisational Management and Reporting.
            I started an company internal programm to become an RPA developer and now I am working as senior specialist for process automation in an expert team for innovation and digitalisation in HR Services.
